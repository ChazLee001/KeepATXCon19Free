            <p>Mainly person-to-person:
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet - twice the length of an iPhone charging cord).
Through droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby and possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Reference: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html">CDC</a>
